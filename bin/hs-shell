# Script to start a nix-shell for a haskell project.
#
# Features:
#
# - Support SSL in shell (useful for testing network applications)
# - Support nix in shell (for example, allows you to run a nix-shell inside a nix-shell)
# - Preserve GTK theme in shell
# - Registers GC roots so that the dependencies are preserved on next GC run
#   (one GC root per GHC version)
# - Allows using a different shell
# - Filter a few useless directories from src (like .git, dist/, etc)
#
# Of course, the disadvantage is that these features make the shell a bit less pure.
#
# The script assumes that there is a default.nix file in the current directory
# that contains a function which takes one argument, haskellngPackages and returns
# either a derivation or a set of derivations.
#
# All command-line arguments are passed to through to the invocation of nix-shell,
# so you can use the same arguments as to nix-shell.
#
# You can set the HS_SHELL_HOOK environment variable to run
# additional commands after the shell is started. Note that HS_SHELL_HOOK
# runs quite early in the shell setup process, so the environment might
# not be fully initialized yet. Use it only to set environment variables, etc.

# We want some environment variables to be preserved, even when using --pure. Because nix-shell doesn't currenlty
# support that natively, we just export them ourselves before invoking cabal.
# These environment variables are useful to test haskell code using the network or interfacing with nix
# inside a nix-shell.
#
# SSL vars: those are needed if we want to fetch SSL signed pages inside nix-shell
# NIX_REMOTE: allows to use nix inside nix-shell
# GTK_PATH, GTK2_RC_FILES: for theming inside nix-shell
