# Script to start a nix-shell which also contains the cabal-install tool
# for a haskell project.
# The script assumes that there is a default.nix file in the current directory
# that takes one argument, haskellPackages.
# All options are passed through to nix-shell.
#
# You can set the HS_SHELL_HOOK environment variable to run
# additional commands after the shell is started.

# Author: Benno Fünfstück

# We want some environment variables to be preserved, even when using --pure. Because nix-shell doesn't currenlty
# support that natively, we just export them ourselves before invoking cabal.
# These environment variables are useful to test haskell code using the network or interfacing with nix
# inside a nix-shell.
#
# SSL vars: those are needed if we want to fetch SSL signed pages inside nix-shell
# NIX_REMOTE: allows to use nix inside nix-shell

# This expression loads default.nix, but also takes care of adding cabalInstall to
# buildInputs, because we want to use cabal inside our shell. It works if default.nix contains
# already a derviation, but also if it contains a function that still requires haskellPackages as
# an argument.

# Because only haskell libraries are GHC-version specific, we'll always use cabal install built
# by GHC 7.8.3, because that's what in the binary cache so we avoid rebuilding. We cannot do the same
# for the Cabal library though, unfortunaly, because it must be built for the GHC that's available
# in the sandbox (we cannot use a Cabal library built for GHC 7.8.3 if we only have GHC 7.6.3 in the sandbox).
